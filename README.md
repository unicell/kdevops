# kdevops

kdevops is a sample framework which lets you easily get your Linux devops
environment going for whatever use case you have. The first use case is to
provide a devops environment for Linux kernel development testing, and hence
the name. The goal behind this project is to let you *easily fork it* and
re-purpose it for whatever kdevops needs you may have.

kdevops relies on vagrant, terraform and ansible to get you going with whatever
your virtualization / bare metal / cloud provisioning environment easily.
It relies heavily on public ansible galaxy roles and terraform modules. This
lets us share as much code as possible with the community and allows us to use
this project as a demo framework which uses theses ansinle roles and terraform
modules.

Each ansible role and terraform module focuses on one specific small goal of
the development focus of kdevops. kdevops then is intended  to be forked so
you can use for whatever kdevops purpose you need.

There are three parts to the long terms ideals for kdevops:

1. Provisioning required virtual hosts / cloud environment
2. Provisioning your requirements
3. Running whatever you want

Ansible is first used to get all the required ansible roles.

Vagrant or terraform can then be used to provision hosts. Vagrant makes use
of two ansible roles to setup update your `~/.ssh/config` and update the
systems with basic development preference files, things like your `.gitconfig`
or bashrc hacks. This last part is handled by the `devconfig` ansible role.
Since your `~/.ssh/config` is updated you can then run further ansible roles
manually when using vagrant. If using terraform for cloud environments, it
updates your `~/.ssh/config` directly without ansible, however since access
to hosts on cloud environments can vary in time running all ansible roles
is expected to be done manually.

The `bootlinux` lets you get Linux, configure it, build it, install it and
reboot into it.

What works?

  * Full vagrant provisioning, including updating your `~/.ssh/config`
  * Terraform provisioning on different cloud providers, and updating
    your `~/.ssh/config` for you
  * Running ansible to install dependencies on debian
  * Using ansible to clone, compile and boot into to any random kernel git tree
    with a supplied config

# Install dependencies

You will have to install ansible, vagrant and terraform first. Do that on your
own, we can later add local ansible roles to do this but for now you are
expected to at least do this on your own. This project has been initially
tested with ansible 2.7.8, Vagrant 2.2.3, and Terraform v0.12.6.

To install further dependencies after you have ansible, vagrant and terraform
installed just run:

```
make deps
```

kdevops relies on a series of ansible roles to allow us to share as much code
as possible with other projects. Next decide if you want to use a series of
already provisioned hosts (say bare metal), provision your own localized VMs,
or use a cloud provider. If you already have your hosts provisioned then skip
to the ansible section. If you need to provision local VMs read the vagrant
section below.  If you want to use a cloud provider read the terraform docs
below.

In the end you will rely on ansible after all hosts are provisioned.

## Vagrant support - localized VMs

Read the [kdevops_vagrant](https://github.com/mcgrof/kdevops_vagrant)
documentation, then come here and read this.

Vagrant is used to easily deploy non-cloud virtual machines. Below are
the list of providers supported:

  * Virtualbox
  * libvirt (KVM)

The following Operating Systems are supported:

  * OS X
  * Linux

### Running libvirt as a regular user

kdevops can be used without requiring root privileges. To do this you must
ensure the user which runs vagrant is part of the following groups:

  * kvm
  * libvirt
  * qemu on Fedora / libvirt-qemu on Debian

Debian uses libvirt-qemu as the userid which runs qemu, Fedora uses qemu.
The qcow2 files created are ensured to allow the default user qemu executes
under by letting the qemu user group to write to them as well. We have the
defaults for debian on this project, to override the default group to use for
qemu set the value need on the environment variable:

  * KDEVOPS_VAGRANT_QEMU_GROUP

You can override the default user qemu will run by modifying
`/etc/libvirt/qemu.conf' user and group settings there. If on a system with
apparmor or selinux enabled, there may be more work required on your part.

Note: we can later add a ansible role to automate the above.

### Node configuration

You configure your node target deployment on the vagrant/${PROJECT}_nodes.yaml
file by default, you however can override what file to use with the environment
variables:

  * KDEVOPS_VAGRANT_NODE_CONFIG

### Provisioning with vagrant

If on Linux we'll assume you are using KVM. If on OS X we'll assume you are
using Virtualbox. If these assumptions are incorrect you can override on the
configuration file for your node provisioning. For instance, for this demo
you'd use `vagrant/kdevops_nodes.yaml` and set the force_provider variable to
either "libvirt" or "kvm". However, since you would typically keep your
`vagrant/kdevops_nodes.yaml` file in version control you can instead use an
environment variable to verride the provider:

  * KDEVOPS_VAGRANT_PROVIDER

You are responsible for having a pretty recent system with some fresh
libvirt, or vitualbox installed. For instance, a virtualbox which supports
nvme.

```bash
make deps
cd vagrant/
vagrant up
```

Say you want to just test the provisioning mechanism:

```bash
vagrant up --provision
```

### Destroying provisioned nodes with vagrant

You can either destroy directly with vagrant:

```bash
cd vagrant/
vagrant destroy -f
# This last step is optional
rm -rf .vagrant
```

Or you can just use virsh directly, if using KVM:

```bash
sudo virsh list --all
sudo virsh destroy name-of-guest
sudo virsh undefine name-of-guest
```

### Limitting vagrant's number of boxes

By default using vagrant will try to create *all* the nodes specified on
your configuration file. By default this is `vagrant/kdevops_nodes.yaml` for
this project, and there are currently 7 nodes there. If you are going to just
test this framework you can limit this initially using environment variables:

```bash
export KDEVOPS_VAGRANT_LIMIT_BOXES="yes"
export KDEVOPS_VAGRANT_LIMIT_NUM_BOXES=1
```

This will ensure only the first host, for example, would be created and
provisioned. This might be useful if you are developing on a laptop, for
example, and you want to limit the amount of resources used.

## Terraform support

Read the [kdevops_terraform](https://github.com/mcgrof/kdevops_terraform)
documentation, then come here and read this.

Terraform is used to deploy your development hosts on cloud virtual machines.
Below are the list of clouds providers currently supported:

  * openstack (special minicloud support added)
  * aws - Amazon Web Service
  * gce - Google Cloud Compute
  * azure - Microsoft Azure

### Provisioning with terraform

```bash
make deps
cd terraform/you_provider
make deps
# Make sure you then add the variables to let you log in to your cloud provider
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

Because *some* buggy cloud providers can take time to make hosts accessible via
ssh, the only thing we strive in terms of initial setup is to update your
`~/ssh/config` for you. Once the hosts become available you are required to run
ansible yourself, including the `devconfig` role:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i hosts playbooks/bootlinux.yml
```

#### Terraform ssh config update

We provide support for updating your ssh configuration file (typically
`~/.ssh/config`) automatically for you, however each cloud provider requires
support to be added in order for this to work. As of this writing we
support this for all cloud providers  we support, however Azure seems to
have a bug, and I'm not yet sure who to blame.

## Running ansible

Before running ansible make sure you can ssh into the hosts listed on
ansible/hosts.

```bash
make ansible-deps
ansible-playbook -i hosts -l dev playbooks/bootlinux.yml
```

Yes you can later add use a different tag for the kernel revision from the
command line, and even add an extra patch to test on top a kernel:

```
ansible-playbook -i hosts -l dev --extra-vars "target_linux_version=4.19.21 target_linux_extra_patch=try-v4.19.20-fixes-20190716-v1.patch" bootlinux.yml
```

You would place the `pend-v4.19.58-fixes-20190716-v2.patch` file into the
`~/.ansible/roles/mcgrof.bootlinux/templates/` directory.

Say you just want to reboot the systems:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i hosts playbooks/bootlinux.yml --tags reboot
```

### Public ansible role documentation

The following public roles are used, and so have respective upstream
documentation which can be used if one wants to modify how the role
runs with additional tags or extra variables from the command line:

  * [create_partition](https://github.com/mcgrof/create_partition)
  * [update_ssh_config_vagrant](https://github.com/mcgrof/update_ssh_config_vagrant)
  * [devconfig](https://github.com/mcgrof/devconfig)
  * [bootlinux](https://github.com/mcgrof/bootlinux)
  * [kdevops_vagrant](https://github.com/mcgrof/kdevops_vagrant)
  * [kdevops_terraform](https://github.com/mcgrof/kdevops_terraform)

Kernel configuration files are tracked in the [bootlinux](https://github.com/mcgrof/bootlinux)
role. If you need to update a kernel configuration for whatever reason, please
submit a patch for the [bootlinux](https://github.com/mcgrof/bootlinux)
role upstream.
